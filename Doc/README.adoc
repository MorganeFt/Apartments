== Convention for naming packages (for papyrus)

* The name of a package must start with the type of diagram he contains (CD, UCD, ID) and should look like this: "TypeOfDiagram_Description‚Äù. +
The only exception is for the `JavaIteration` package as it may contain different type of diagram.
* When you create a new child such as a use case or a new class, the name of it should finish with "UC‚Äù if it is a use case, "CD‚Äù if it is for a class diagram or "I‚Äù for an interaction diagram.
