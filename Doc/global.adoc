+
As the main user of the application will be the tenants (see link:README.adoc#users-roles[users roles]), we have identified several actions that the tenants will be able to do.
+
The main use case of the application will then be to look for an apartment that the user of the app will rent for a long period of time. +
The user, during his/her research, will be able to indicate his/her preferences (for example, the user is looking for an apartment with a terrace) and to obtain a sorted list of apartments after filling all the criteria. +
The first apartment in the list will be the best match between the characteristics of the location and the user’s criteria.
